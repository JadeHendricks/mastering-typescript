- It does this error checking on the basis of the "kinds of data" in our program again types.

Why types?
- It helps us find errors.
- It analyzes our code as we types.
- Only exists in development.

What is type inference?
- Type inference refers to typescript compilers ability to infer types from certain values in your code
- Typescript can remember a values type even if you didn't provide a type annotation, and it will enforce that type moving forward.
